# Daraz Platform

This is a simple ecommerce Express server using PostgreSQL as the database.

## How to Run

To run the project, you need to use Docker Compose. Running the `docker-compose.yaml` file will start both the PostgreSQL database and the Express server, and will also automatically run the database migrations and insert the seed data.

Execute the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
